# Capstone-Sample-Code
This repository contains some sample code from my EECE Capstone Project. For a detailed description of the project, see the final report included in the repository.

plot_room_attenuation.m is a script that plots the attenuation pattern of a 2D slice of a two array beamforming mic array system with arrays on the right and left side of a room.

plot_room_d_lam.m plots multiple room attenuation patterns for different values of $frac{d}{\lambda}$
